# Salary-Predictor-AI-model
I tried some of basic stuff and made what i could the best of it and here are teh breif intro about this
so basically 
I developed a Salary Predictor AI model using the Linear Regression method. This model analyzes historical salary data and identifies patterns based on features such as experience, education, and job role. By fitting a linear equation to the data, it predicts future salaries with reasonable accuracy. The model is trained on labeled datasets, optimizing the relationship between input features and salary outcomes. It is useful for job seekers, HR professionals, and businesses to estimate expected salaries based on given parameters.
